# Skills Section Design Variations

I've created 4 different design variations for your skills section. Each is now a separate route you can visit in your browser.

## How to Preview

Visit these URLs in your browser (after running `npm run dev`):

- **Version 2 (Tags):** http://localhost:3000/skills-v2-tags
- **Version 3 (List):** http://localhost:3000/skills-v3-list
- **Version 4 (Cards):** http://localhost:3000/skills-v4-cards
- **Version 5 (Grid):** http://localhost:3000/skills-v5-grid

Navigate between them to compare the designs side-by-side!

## Design Variations

### ✅ Version 2: Horizontal Tags (`/skills-v2-tags`)
**Style:** Like GitHub topics - flowing tags with icons
- **RECOMMENDED** - Very clean and minimal
- All skills in one flowing row
- No descriptions, just icon + name
- Takes minimal vertical space
- Good for: Developers who want a clean, concise look

### ✅ Version 3: Compact List (`/skills-v3-list`)
**Style:** Vertical list with icons
- Traditional list format
- Icon on left, skill name on right
- Very readable and scannable
- Groups skills by category
- Good for: Organized, professional look

### ✅ Version 4: Large Icon Cards (`/skills-v4-cards`)
**Style:** Large cards with prominent icons
- Most visual impact
- Icons in colored containers
- Good spacing between items
- More "designed" feel
- Good for: Creative portfolios, visual emphasis

### ✅ Version 5: Two-Column Grid (`/skills-v5-grid`)
**Style:** Balanced grid layout
- Skills in two columns
- Icon + name in horizontal rows
- Efficient use of space
- Balanced, professional look
- Good for: Many skills, organized presentation

## My Recommendation

Based on your request for "just icons and writing, no descriptions," I recommend:

1. **Version 2 (Horizontal Tags)** - Cleanest, most minimal
2. **Version 4 (Large Icon Cards)** - Best visual impact
3. **Version 3 (Compact List)** - Most traditional/professional

Try each one and see which feels right for your portfolio!
